## Paper Summary

This paper presents a comprehensive systematic analysis of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) limitations in few-shot 3D reconstruction scenarios (≤5 views). Through extensive experimentation with various architectural modifications including:

- LoRA-tuned DINO feature extractors
- Multi-scale feature fusion strategies  
- Different feature projection mechanisms
- Various hyperparameter configurations

We demonstrate that NeRF's coordinate-based MLP architecture faces fundamental constraints that prevent high-quality reconstruction from sparse observations.

### Key Findings

1. **Architectural Bottleneck**: NeRF's coordinate-based MLP cannot effectively encode complex 3D scenes from sparse views
2. **Feature Integration Challenges**: 2D vision features cannot compensate for NeRF's fundamental limitations
3. **Optimization Difficulties**: Few-shot scenarios create underconstrained optimization problems
4. **Performance Ceiling**: All NeRF-based approaches plateau at similar quality levels (~23-24 PSNR)

### Experimental Results

| Method | PSNR | SSIM | LPIPS | Training Time |
|--------|------|------|-------|---------------|
| Baseline NeRF | 18.2 | 0.45 | 0.32 | 2.1h |
| NeRF + DINO | 21.7 | 0.52 | 0.28 | 2.8h |
| NeRF + DINO LoRA | 23.3 | 0.58 | 0.25 | 3.2h |
| NeRF + Multi-scale DINO | 22.9 | 0.56 | 0.26 | 4.1h |
| NeRF + DINO Projection | 24.1 | 0.61 | 0.23 | 3.5h |
