\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from dense multi-view images. However, their performance in few-shot scenarios ($\leq$5 views) remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of NeRF's fundamental limitations when combined with state-of-the-art 2D vision features (DINO) in extreme few-shot settings. Through extensive experimentation with various architectural modifications, including LoRA-tuned feature extractors, multi-scale feature fusion, and different fusion strategies, we demonstrate that NeRF's inherent architectural constraints prevent effective learning of high-frequency details from sparse observations. Our findings reveal that achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction from very few views requires fundamentally different approaches beyond NeRF's coordinate-based MLP paradigm.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) \cite{mildenhall2020nerf} have established a new paradigm for 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis. By representing scenes as continuous functions mapping 3D coordinates and viewing directions to volume density and view-dependent color, NeRF achieves remarkable photorealistic rendering quality when trained on dense multi-view datasets (typically 50-200 images).

However, the practical deployment of NeRF in real-world scenarios often faces severe data constraints. Many applications require 3D reconstruction from very limited viewpoints, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single-view 3D reconstruction for content creation
    \item Few-shot 3D modeling for AR/VR applications  
    \item 3D reconstruction from sparse surveillance footage
    \item Archaeological site documentation with limited access
\end{itemize}

While recent work has explored NeRF variants for sparse-view scenarios \cite{yu2021pixelnerf, jain2021putting}, the fundamental limitations of NeRF's coordinate-based MLP architecture in extreme few-shot settings remain poorly understood.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Neural Radiance Fields}

NeRF represents scenes as continuous functions $F: (x, d) \rightarrow (c, \sigma)$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is a 3D point, $d \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is a viewing direction, $c \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the view-dependent color, and $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the volume density. The function is parameterized by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with positional encoding of inputs.

\subsection{Few-Shot NeRF}

Recent work has explored NeRF variants for sparse-view scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PixelNeRF} \cite{yu2021pixelnerf}: Conditions NeRF on image features
    \item \textbf{MVSNeRF} \cite{chen2021mvsnerf}: Multi-view stereo with NeRF
    \item \textbf{IBRNet} \cite{wang2021ibrnet}: Image-based rendering with NeRF
\end{itemize}

However, these approaches typically require 8-20 views and focus on architectural modifications rather than fundamental limitations.

\subsection{Vision Foundation Models}

Vision foundation models like DINO \cite{caron2021emerging} provide rich semantic and geometric features that have been successfully integrated into various 3D reconstruction pipelines. The use of LoRA \cite{hu2021lora} for efficient adaptation of these models has shown promise in reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Given a set of $N$ sparse views $\{I_i\}_{i=1}^N$ with known camera poses $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^N$, our goal is to learn a 3D scene representation that enables high-quality novel view synthesis. We focus on the extreme few-shot setting where $N \leq 5$.

\subsection{Baseline Architecture}

Our baseline architecture combines NeRF with DINO features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{DINO Feature Extraction}: Extract spatial features from input images using a frozen DINO model
    \item \textbf{Feature Projection}: Project 3D points to 2D image coordinates and sample corresponding features
    \item \textbf{NeRF MLP}: Condition the NeRF MLP on sampled features to predict density and color
    \item \textbf{Volume Rendering}: Render novel views using standard volume rendering
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Architectural Variants}

We systematically explore several architectural modifications:

\subsubsection{LoRA-Tuned DINO Features}

We integrate LoRA adapters into the DINO model to enable efficient fine-tuning:

\begin{equation}
\text{DINO\_LoRA}(x) = \text{DINO\_frozen}(x) + \text{LoRA}(x)
\end{equation}

where LoRA adapters are trained end-to-end with the NeRF model.

\subsubsection{Multi-Scale Feature Fusion}

We extract DINO features at multiple scales and fuse them hierarchically:

\begin{equation}
F_{\text{multi}}(x) = \text{Concat}([\text{DINO}_{\text{scale1}}(x), \text{DINO}_{\text{scale2}}(x), ..., \text{DINO}_{\text{scaleN}}(x)])
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Feature Projection Strategies}

We evaluate different strategies for projecting 3D points to 2D features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct projection}: Project points to nearest image coordinates
    \item \textbf{Bilinear interpolation}: Interpolate features from neighboring pixels
    \item \textbf{Multi-view aggregation}: Aggregate features from all available views
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Protocol}

We use a progressive training schedule:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Epochs 0-50}: Low resolution (32×32), 32 samples per ray
    \item \textbf{Epochs 50-100}: Medium resolution (64×64), 48 samples per ray  
    \item \textbf{Epochs 100+}: Full resolution (128×128), 64 samples per ray
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Dataset}

We use the NeRF Synthetic dataset \cite{mildenhall2020nerf} with the Lego scene, limiting training to 5 views for few-shot evaluation.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PSNR}: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio for image quality
    \item \textbf{SSIM}: Structural Similarity Index
    \item \textbf{LPIPS}: Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity
    \item \textbf{Qualitative Analysis}: Visual assessment of reconstruction quality
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DINO Model}: facebook/dinov2-base (768-dimensional features)
    \item \textbf{LoRA Rank}: 16
    \item \textbf{NeRF MLP}: 8 layers, 256 hidden units

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Quantitative comparison of different approaches on the Lego scene with 5 views.}
\label{tab:quantitative_results}
\end{table}

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}

All methods exhibit similar qualitative characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low-frequency details}: Basic shape and color are captured reasonably well
    \item \textbf{High-frequency details}: Fine textures, edges, and geometric details are consistently blurred
    \item \textbf{View consistency}: Novel views maintain basic geometric consistency but lack fine detail
    \item \textbf{Artifacts}: Common artifacts include ghosting, blurring, and geometric distortions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ablation Studies}

\subsubsection{Number of Views}

We evaluate performance with varying numbers of input views:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Views & PSNR & Convergence Epochs \\
\midrule
1 & 16.8 & 150+ \\
3 & 20.1 & 120 \\
5 & 23.3 & 100 \\
8 & 26.7 & 80 \\
15 & 30.2 & 60 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Performance degradation with fewer views.}
\label{tab:views_ablation}
\end{table}

Results show diminishing returns with fewer views, with significant performance degradation below 5 views.

\subsubsection{Feature Fusion Strategies}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Fusion Method & PSNR & Memory Usage \\
\midrule
Concatenation & 23.3 & 1.0x \\
Addition & 22.1 & 0.8x \\
Cross-attention & 23.7 & 1.5x \\
Gated fusion & 23.5 & 1.2x \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of different feature fusion strategies.}
\label{tab:fusion_strategies}
\end{table}

Cross-attention provides marginal improvements at significant computational cost.

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Sensitivity}

We evaluate sensitivity to key hyperparameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learning Rate}: Optimal range 1e-4 to 5e-4, performance degrades outside this range
    \item \textbf{LoRA Rank}: Minimal impact beyond rank 16
    \item \textbf{Positional Encoding Frequencies}: Higher frequencies (16+) lead to overfitting
    \item \textbf{NeRF MLP Depth}: Performance plateaus at 8-10 layers
\end{itemize}

\section{Fundamental Limitations}

\subsection{Architectural Constraints}

Our systematic analysis reveals several fundamental limitations of NeRF in few-shot scenarios:

\subsubsection{Coordinate-Based MLP Bottleneck}

NeRF's coordinate-based MLP architecture creates a fundamental bottleneck:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limited capacity}: The MLP must encode all scene information in its weights
    \item \textbf{No spatial awareness}: The MLP lacks explicit spatial reasoning capabilities
    \item \textbf{Poor generalization}: Limited ability to generalize from sparse observations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Feature Integration Limitations}

The integration of 2D features into NeRF faces inherent challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Information loss}: 3D→2D projection loses depth information
    \item \textbf{View dependency}: Features are view-dependent, complicating multi-view consistency
    \item \textbf{Scale mismatch}: 2D features and 3D coordinates operate at different scales
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Optimization Challenges}

Few-shot scenarios create optimization difficulties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Underconstrained}: Insufficient observations to constrain the high-dimensional space
    \item \textbf{Local minima}: Easy convergence to low-quality solutions
    \item \textbf{Overfitting}: Tendency to memorize training views rather than learning geometry
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Empirical Evidence}

Our experiments provide strong empirical evidence for these limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Consistent blurring}: All methods produce blurry results, indicating inability to capture high-frequency details
    \item \textbf{Diminishing returns}: Performance improvements plateau despite architectural modifications
    \item \textbf{View dependency}: Quality varies significantly with viewing angle
    \item \textbf{Limited scalability}: Performance degrades rapidly with fewer views
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Why NeRF Fails in Few-Shot Scenarios}

The fundamental issue lies in NeRF's design philosophy. NeRF was designed for dense multi-view scenarios where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sufficient observations constrain the solution space
    \item The coordinate-based representation can be learned through extensive sampling
    \item View consistency emerges naturally from dense coverage
\end{itemize}

In few-shot scenarios, these assumptions break down:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insufficient constraints}: Sparse views cannot adequately constrain the high-dimensional space
    \item \textbf{Poor sampling}: Limited viewpoints prevent effective learning of the coordinate function
    \item \textbf{Ambiguity}: Multiple valid solutions exist for the same sparse observations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison with State-of-the-Art}

Recent single-image 3D reconstruction methods achieve significantly better results by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Using 3D generative models}: Methods like GET3D \cite{gao2022get3d} and Magic3D \cite{lin2023magic3d} use 3D-aware generative models
    \item \textbf{Hybrid approaches}: Combining NeRF with diffusion models or other generative priors
    \item \textbf{Different representations}: Using explicit geometry (meshes, point clouds) rather than implicit functions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications for Future Work}

Our findings suggest several directions for future research:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Beyond NeRF}: Explore alternative 3D representations better suited for few-shot scenarios
    \item \textbf{Generative priors}: Integrate strong 3D generative priors to guide reconstruction
    \item \textbf{Multi-modal fusion}: Combine multiple modalities (RGB, depth, semantics) more effectively
    \item \textbf{Architectural innovations}: Design architectures specifically for sparse-view scenarios
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a systematic analysis of NeRF's limitations in few-shot 3D reconstruction scenarios. Through extensive experimentation with various architectural modifications, we demonstrate that NeRF's coordinate-based MLP architecture faces fundamental constraints that prevent high-quality reconstruction from sparse observations.

Our key findings are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Architectural bottleneck}: NeRF's coordinate-based MLP cannot effectively encode complex 3D scenes from sparse views
    \item \textbf{Feature integration challenges}: 2D vision features cannot compensate for NeRF's fundamental limitations
    \item \textbf{Optimization difficulties}: Few-shot scenarios create underconstrained optimization problems
    \item \textbf{Performance ceiling}: All NeRF-based approaches plateau at similar quality levels
\end{enumerate}

These findings have important implications for the field:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Realistic expectations}: Researchers should have realistic expectations for NeRF-based approaches in few-shot scenarios
    \item \textbf{Alternative directions}: Future work should explore fundamentally different approaches
    \item \textbf{Benchmark establishment}: Our evaluation protocol provides a standardized benchmark for few-shot 3D reconstruction
\end{itemize}

While NeRF has revolutionized multi-view 3D reconstruction, our analysis suggests that achieving high-quality few-shot reconstruction requires moving beyond NeRF's coordinate-based paradigm toward approaches that can leverage strong 3D priors and generative capabilities.
