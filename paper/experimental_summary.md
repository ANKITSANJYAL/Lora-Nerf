## Qualitative Analysis

### Common Artifacts Across All Methods

1. **Blurring**: All methods produce blurry results, especially in high-frequency regions
2. **Ghosting**: Duplicate or semi-transparent objects in novel views
3. **Geometric Distortions**: Incorrect 3D geometry, especially in occluded regions
4. **View Inconsistency**: Quality varies significantly with viewing angle
5. **Texture Loss**: Fine textures and details are consistently lost

### View-Dependent Quality

- **Frontal Views**: Best quality, closest to training views
- **Side Views**: Moderate quality, some geometric errors
- **Back Views**: Poor quality, significant artifacts
- **Occluded Regions**: Very poor quality, often completely wrong

## Training Dynamics

### Loss Curves
- **RGB Loss**: Decreases rapidly in first 50 epochs, then plateaus
- **Depth Loss**: Shows high variance, difficult to optimize
- **Regularization Loss**: Helps prevent overfitting but limits detail

### Convergence Patterns
- **Early Phase (0-50 epochs)**: Rapid improvement, basic shape learning
- **Middle Phase (50-100 epochs)**: Slower improvement, texture refinement
- **Late Phase (100+ epochs)**: Minimal improvement, potential overfitting

## Computational Analysis

### Memory Usage
- **Baseline NeRF**: 8GB peak memory
- **DINO Integration**: 10GB peak memory
- **LoRA Adaptation**: 12GB peak memory
- **Multi-scale**: 14GB peak memory

### Training Efficiency
- **Baseline**: 2.1 hours for 200 epochs
- **DINO Integration**: 2.8 hours for 200 epochs
- **LoRA Adaptation**: 3.2 hours for 200 epochs
- **Multi-scale**: 4.1 hours for 200 epochs

## Failure Modes Analysis

### 1. Underconstrained Optimization
- **Symptom**: Multiple valid solutions for same sparse observations
- **Evidence**: High variance in results across different initializations
- **Impact**: Inconsistent reconstruction quality

### 2. Feature-3D Mismatch
- **Symptom**: 2D features don't translate to 3D understanding
- **Evidence**: Good 2D feature quality but poor 3D reconstruction
- **Impact**: Limited improvement from better features

### 3. Coordinate-Based Bottleneck
- **Symptom**: MLP cannot encode complex 3D scenes
- **Evidence**: Performance plateaus regardless of architectural changes
- **Impact**: Fundamental limitation of NeRF architecture

## Statistical Significance

### Confidence Intervals
- **PSNR**: ±0.5 dB (95% confidence)
- **SSIM**: ±0.03 (95% confidence)
- **LPIPS**: ±0.02 (95% confidence)

### Reproducibility
- All experiments run 3 times with different random seeds
- Results consistent across runs
- Standard deviation < 0.3 PSNR across runs

## Comparison with Literature

### State-of-the-Art Comparison
| Method | Views | PSNR | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|-------|
| PixelNeRF | 1-8 | 25-30 | Requires dense training data |
| MVSNeRF | 8-20 | 28-32 | Not designed for few-shot |
| IBRNet | 8-15 | 26-31 | Image-based rendering |
| Our Best | 5 | 24.1 | Few-shot setting |

**Key Insight**: Our results are competitive in the few-shot setting, but all methods show fundamental limitations.

## Conclusions from Experiments

1. **Architectural Bottleneck**: NeRF's coordinate-based MLP fundamentally limits few-shot performance
2. **Feature Integration**: 2D features provide limited improvement due to 3D projection challenges
3. **Optimization Challenges**: Few-shot scenarios create underconstrained problems
4. **Performance Ceiling**: All NeRF-based approaches plateau at ~23-24 PSNR with 5 views
5. **Computational Cost**: More complex architectures don't provide proportional benefits

## Future Work Implications

### Promising Directions
1. **3D Generative Models**: GET3D, Magic3D show better results
2. **Hybrid Approaches**: NeRF + Diffusion models
3. **Alternative Representations**: Explicit geometry (meshes, point clouds)
4. **Multi-modal Fusion**: RGB + Depth + Semantics

### Less Promising Directions
1. **NeRF Architectural Modifications**: Limited returns
2. **Feature Engineering**: 2D features insufficient
3. **Optimization Tricks**: Address symptoms, not root cause
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Don't solve fundamental limitations
