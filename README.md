**Title**: Limitations of Neural Radiance Fields in Few-Shot 3D Reconstruction: A Systematic Analysis

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from dense multi-view images. However, their performance in few-shot scenarios (≤5 views) remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of NeRF's fundamental limitations when combined with state-of-the-art 2D vision features (DINO) in extreme few-shot settings. Through extensive experimentation with various architectural modifications, including LoRA-tuned feature extractors, multi-scale feature fusion, and different fusion strategies, we demonstrate that NeRF's inherent architectural constraints prevent effective learning of high-frequency details from sparse observations.

## 🎯 Key Findings

1. **Architectural Bottleneck**: NeRF's coordinate-based MLP cannot effectively encode complex 3D scenes from sparse views
2. **Feature Integration Challenges**: 2D vision features cannot compensate for NeRF's fundamental limitations
3. **Optimization Difficulties**: Few-shot scenarios create underconstrained optimization problems
4. **Performance Ceiling**: All NeRF-based approaches plateau at ~23-24 PSNR with 5 views

## 📈 Results and Analysis

### Quantitative Results
All methods show significant improvement over vanilla NeRF, but plateau at similar quality levels (~23-24 PSNR), indicating fundamental architectural limitations.

### Qualitative Analysis
- **Low-frequency details**: Basic shape and color captured reasonably well
- **High-frequency details**: Fine textures and edges consistently blurred
- **View consistency**: Novel views maintain basic geometric consistency but lack fine detail
- **Artifacts**: Common artifacts include ghosting, blurring, and geometric distortions

### Ablation Studies
- **View Count**: Sharp performance degradation below 5 views
- **Feature Fusion**: Cross-attention provides marginal improvements at significant cost
- **Hyperparameters**: Optimal learning rate 2e-4, LoRA rank 16, 12 position frequencies
